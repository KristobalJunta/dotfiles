BINARIES
========

Here is some software that I use as binaries outside of system package management.
Usually, these are located under $HOME/bin.

- bat (https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) - A cat(1) clone with syntax highlighting and Git integration.
- Delta (https://github.com/dandavison/delta) - A syntax-highlighter for git and diff output
- dust (https://github.com/bootandy/dust) - A more intuitive version of du in rust
- ngrok (https://github.com/inconshreveable/ngrok) - Introspected tunnels to localhost
- Starship (https://starship.rs/) - The minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell!
- Telegram (https://telegram.org/) - messaging
- UPX (https://github.com/upx/upx) - the Ultimate Packer for eXecutables
